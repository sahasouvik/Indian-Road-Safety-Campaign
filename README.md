# Indian-Road-Safety-Campaign
Accidents are a serious thread to human life.In order to stop unnecessary loss we have to prevent and reduce the number of road accidents.To proceed with this task we have to know the cause of accidents.This is a part of the Road Safety Campaign.One dataset represents the x and y axis accelerations recorded by phone accelerometer for the case when a phone falls on the ground. The other dataset represent the x and y axis acceleration recorded by phone accelerometer when it is in a car which experiences a crash.Make a predictive tool which takes into account two inputs, i.e. x and y axis accelerations. The tool should be able to determine whether the phone has fallen or it is a car accident.
